# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
## ðŸ”° Introduction

Sentiment analysis refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source. Tweets are often useful in generating a vast amount of sentiment data upon analysis. These data are useful in understanding the opinion of the people about a variety of topics.

Therefore, we need to develop an **Automated Machine Learning Sentiment Analysis Model** in order to compute the customer perception. Due to the presence of non-useful characters (collectively termed as *noise*) along with useful data, it becomes difficult to implement models on them.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

We aim to analyze the sentiment of the tweets provided from the **Sentiment140** dataset by developing a Machine Learning model involving the use of three classifiers:

- **Logistic Regression (LR)**
- **Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Along with using **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**.

The performance of these classifiers is then evaluated using:

- **Accuracy**
- **ROC-AUC Curve**
- **F1 Scores**
